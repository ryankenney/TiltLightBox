This directory is just a graveyard for accumulated tools and code samples.

Arduino
----------

### arduino/color_change_demo

A basic demo of color cycling on an Arduino.

### arduino/tilt_switch_5050_rf_controller_receiver

This is an example of the simplest nRF24L01 transmitter I got working. Pair this with the "_sender" module.

### arduino/tilt_switch_5050_rf_controller_sender

This is an example of the simplest nRF24L01 receiver I got working. Pair this with the "_receiver" module.

### arduino/tilt-light-box_arduino-listener

A basic demo of a receiver of TILT messages from a tilt-light-box, implemented on Arduino. This is just a demo, as TILT messages will be received by a Raspberry Pi, not an Arduino at the end of the day.

Fritzing
----------

### fritzing/arduino-uno-tilt-switch-5050-controller-shield.fzz

A sketch of a 5v Arduino used to control a 12v LED strip, each with their own independent
power supply (but a common ground). This is a modified (fixed) version of something I found
online, but I've since lost the reference to.

Eagle
----------

### eagle/r0.2.6

The first PCB I ordered. It supports a 5.5v Arduino controlling 12v LED strips. 

### eagle/r0.4.0

The PCB I brought to Burning Man 2015.
